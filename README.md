Post Workload Calculator

Overview

The Post Workload Calculator is a web-based tool designed to estimate the time required for postal workers (postmen) to complete their delivery tasks based on standardized workload factors. It differentiates between congested and less congested areas, incorporating various delivery items and travel modes. This tool helps in assessing workload efficiency by comparing calculated times against standard benchmarks, such as the typical 4-hour duty period under Time-Related Continuity Allowance (TRCA) systems. By providing data-driven insights, it supports fair evaluation of task durations to ensure alignment between assigned duties and actual time commitments, promoting equitable resource allocation in postal operations.

Purpose

Postal services often operate under time-bound frameworks where compensation and scheduling are tied to estimated workloads. This calculator enables users to input specific delivery volumes and travel distances to compute total time expenditures. It can be used by postal staff, supervisors, or analysts to:
- Validate if current workloads are sustainable within standard hours.
- Identify potential discrepancies between planned and actual time requirements.
- Facilitate discussions on operational improvements and fair labor practices.

Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple HTML-based form for entering data on 16 workload items, including sub-categories for travel (foot and bicycle).
- **Area-Specific Calculations**: Separate inputs and factors for congested and less congested areas to reflect real-world variations.
- **Automated Results**: Instant computation of total times in minutes and hours, with breakdowns for key components.
- **Open-Source and Free**: Accessible for public use, with no dependencies beyond a web browser.

How to Use

1. **Access the Tool**:
   - Open the `post-workload-calculator.html` file in any modern web browser.
   - Alternatively, host it on a platform like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or your own website for online access.

2. **Input Data**:
   - Enter numerical values for each item in the "Congested Area Data" and "Less Congested Area Data" columns.
   - Items 1–15 represent specific delivery types (e.g., unregistered mail, money orders).
   - Item 16 includes sub-items:
     - Distance travelled by foot (in km).
     - Distance travelled by bicycle (in km).
   - Use decimal values if needed (e.g., 1.5 km).

3. **Calculate**:
   - Click the "Calculate" button to process the inputs.
   - Results will display below, including:
     - Total Congested Area Time (minutes).
     - Total Less Congested Area Time (minutes).
     - Time for bicycle travel in each area (minutes).
     - Overall Total Time (minutes and hours).

4. **Interpretation**:
   - Compare the "Total Time Taken (hours)" against the standard 4-hour benchmark.
   - If the calculated time exceeds the standard, it may indicate a need for workload adjustments, additional resources, or route optimizations to maintain efficiency and employee well-being.

Calculation Logic

The tool uses predefined factors from postal workload standards:
- Congested Area Factors: [0.72, 0.72, 0.285, 2.5, 4.5, 3, 2.5, 3.85, 2.5, 2, 2.5, 3.5, 2.5, 1.8, 20] for items 1–15.
- Less Congested Area Factors: [0.72, 0.72, 0.29, 2.5, 4.5, 3, 2.5, 3.85, 2.5, 2, 2.5, 3.5, 2.5, 1.8, 20] for items 1–15.
- Travel Factors:
  - Foot: 19 minutes/km (congested), 15 minutes/km (less congested).
  - Bicycle: 10 minutes/km (congested), 8 minutes/km (less congested).

Time for each item is calculated as: `Factor × Input Value`. Totals are summed, with travel times added separately.

Example

Using sample data:
- Congested: Item 1 = 65, Item 2 = 2, ..., Bicycle = 1 km.
- Less Congested: Item 1 = 15, ..., Bicycle = 4 km.

Expected Output:
- Total Time: Approximately 4.46 hours (adjust based on full inputs).

Hosting and Customization

- **Local Use**: No installation required—just open the HTML file.
- **Online Hosting**:
  - Upload to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages.
  - Deploy via Netlify or Vercel for a custom URL.
- **Customization**: Edit the HTML/CSS/JS directly (e.g., add saving features using localStorage).

Limitations

- This is a client-side tool; all calculations occur in the browser.
- Factors are based on provided standards and may need updates for regulatory changes.
- Does not account for external variables like weather or traffic; use as an estimation aid.
